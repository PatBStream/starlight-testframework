# Test case execution sequence definition file
# -----------------------------------
# > each line represents a test case execution schedule
# > the test case execution is in serial mode
# > each case execution sequence definition includes the following fileds (colon separated)
#    0) Test case name (must have a corresponding "test case" subdirectory under "testcases/raw_definition"). 
#       Otherwise, its execution is ignored
#    1) The pause time after the execution of the current test case finishes before starting the next test case execution
#    2) The full path of the pre-task shell script to run before the execution start of the current test
#         Can use 'glb_default' to point to the global default pre-task shell script at "bash/tc_exec_dft/pre_task.sh"
#         Can use 'tc_default' to point to the test case specific default pre-task shell script at "testcases/raw_definition/<tc_name>/pre_task.sh"
#         Will be ignored if none of the pre-task shell script (specified, global default, testcase default) can be found
#    3) The full path of the post-task shell script to run before the execution start of the current test
#         Can use 'glb_default' to point to the global default pre-task shell script at "bash/tc_exec_dft/post_task.sh"
#         Can use 'tc_default' to point to the test case specific default pre-task shell script at "testcases/raw_definition/<tc_name>/post_task.sh"
#         Will be ignored if none of the post-task shell script (specified, global default, testcase default) can be found
